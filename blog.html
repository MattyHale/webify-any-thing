          <p>
            Short, operational updates on what happens when Earth Observation programs run like modern data systems—from supplier
            realities to playbooks you can adopt today.
          <h1 id="blog-hero-title">The Missing Layer in Earth Observation</h1>
          <p>
            Every modern data system assumes one thing: infrastructure. Whether it’s aviation safety, border security, wildfire risk, or commodity logistics,
            the data flows through structured systems with built-in automation, access control, and observability. Earth Observation is the outlier.

              <h2 id="dec-2025-title">The uncomfortable truth about the large imagery supplier</h2>
              <p class="lede">
                Everyone in Earth Observation knows them—global footprint, heritage satellites, seemingly endless demand. On paper, they
                should set the benchmark. In practice, delivery is still manual and every customer pays the price.
              </p>
            </header>
            <div class="blog-entry__body">
              <p>
                Despite the scale of their space assets, the customer experience is still running on manual processes. Orders move through
                inboxes. Delivery timing depends on human availability. Workflows that should be triggered by APIs are instead handled
                through coordination emails. The friction is unnecessary and every downstream organisation ends up paying for it in time,
                money and operational risk.
              </p>
              <p>The problem isn’t the satellites. It’s the absence of infrastructure.</p>

              <h3>The supplier becomes the bottleneck</h3>
              <p>
                A request can be captured in orbit within minutes, yet analysts and field teams may wait days or weeks for usable data. The
                blocker isn’t physics. It’s the delivery model.
              </p>
              <p>This slowdown doesn’t just delay insights. It undermines operational trust.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Analysts idle while data is “on the way”</li>
                <li>Field operations halt or reroute</li>
                <li>Decision-makers lose confidence</li>
                <li>Program budgets get redirected to manual workarounds</li>
              </ul>
              <p>It’s not satellite tasking complexity. It’s infrastructure debt.</p>

              <h3>Other industries solved this a long time ago</h3>
              <p>
                Banking wouldn’t tolerate manual data exchanges. Aviation wouldn’t accept PDF-based telemetry. Healthcare wouldn’t run
                hospitals through spreadsheet attachments. Yet the EO sector excuses outdated delivery models simply because legacy
                suppliers have normalised them.
              </p>

              <h3>Enterprises and defence now need to own their EODI strategy</h3>
              <p>
                Relying on imagery suppliers to drive the data infrastructure agenda has proven ineffective. Their business incentives
                optimise for licensing scenes, not for improving customer workflows.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a defence program, mining operator or government agency needs operational reliability, they cannot allow an imagery
                provider to dictate the speed, accessibility or usability of the data that drives mission outcomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                A true Earth Observation Data Infrastructure strategy must be owned by the customer — not outsourced to a supplier whose
                incentives are misaligned.
              </p>

              <h3>The market is shifting</h3>
              <p>
                The winners in EO will not be the companies with the most satellites. They will be the ones who deliver usable data directly
                into operational systems—fast, consistently and securely.
              </p>
              <p>
                Organisations that take ownership of their EODI strategy will move faster, integrate more sources, and avoid being slowed
                down by legacy supplier workflows.
              </p>
              <p>The satellites are not the problem. The lack of infrastructure is.</p>
              <p>The organisations that take control of their infrastructure are the ones who will unlock the real value of EO.</p>

              <p class="lede">
                Earth Observation programs have more satellites than ever, yet data still moves through PDFs, ad-hoc portals and inboxes.
                The blocker isn’t orbital capacity—it’s the absence of infrastructure.
              </p>
            </header>
            <div class="blog-entry__body">
              <p>
                Even with more satellites in orbit than ever before, EO programs still rely on PDFs, ad-hoc portals and email chains to
                move data. Delays appear at every stage—not because of satellites, but because there is no infrastructure layer connecting
                upstream sources to downstream decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Without that layer, EO programs stall. Imagery sits idle. Operators burn hours scheduling. Analysts spend time converting
                formats instead of interpreting events. Sensors in orbit don’t translate into visibility on the ground.
              </p>

              <h3>Infrastructure is the fix</h3>
              <p>
                An EO program that runs on infrastructure doesn’t treat imagery as a “file to deliver.” It treats it as data: ordered,
                standardised, governed, routed and delivered the same way every other mission-critical dataset already is.
              </p>
              <p>This shift is now unavoidable. The pressure is appearing first in the sectors where reliability matters most.</p>

              <h4>Operational risk — National security, maritime domain awareness</h4>
              <p>
                These organisations are not short on imagery. They are short on control. Tasking is still routed manually. Scheduling
                decisions are decoupled from field requirements. Fulfilment lives in disconnected systems with no audit trail and no time
                guarantees.
              </p>
              <p>Under EODI:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Tasking requests are API-triggered, not emailed</li>
                <li>Constellations (sovereign, allied, commercial) are coordinated in one system</li>
                <li>Capture conditions are modelled automatically</li>
                <li>Deliveries are traceable, format-aligned and ISR-ready</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The result is not just faster imagery. It’s predictable latency and reduced uncertainty in time-critical operations.</p>

              <h4>Environmental monitoring — Tailings, methane, wildfire, weed detection</h4>
              <p>
                Monitoring programs often have sensors, schedules and compliance requirements—but no reactive loop. A dam sensor triggers an
                alert, emails go out, and then someone manually checks satellite availability. Imagery might arrive long after the event.
              </p>
              <p>Under EODI:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Threshold breaches trigger satellite and drone tasking automatically</li>
                <li>Multi-sensor assets are scheduled together (optical, SAR, thermal)</li>
                <li>Raw imagery is normalised and converted on ingest</li>
                <li>Results route into dashboards, SCADA overlays and audit systems</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This structure reduces blind spots and ensures every incident is tied to clear visual evidence.</p>

              <h4>EO &amp; space data — Satellite operators, imagery aggregators, space agencies</h4>
              <p>
                For most satellite operators, fulfilment still scales by headcount. Orders come in via forms or emails. Tasking is managed in
                spreadsheets. Archive access requires manual approval. It’s effective for small volumes, but not for growth.
              </p>
              <p>With EODI:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Customers self-serve tasking and archive access</li>
                <li>Feasibility logic runs automatically via digital twin simulation</li>
                <li>Fulfilment is routed and tracked end-to-end</li>
                <li>Delivery is searchable, standardised and usage-governed</li>
              </ul>
              <p>A manual order desk becomes a scalable data platform.</p>

                After six months, EO data moves the way it should: securely, automatically and predictably—through infrastructure, not
                inboxes and/or phones.
              </p>
            </div>
          </article>

        <div class="container narrow blog-article">
          <p>
            Despite the rise of satellites and sensors, EO programs still rely on PDFs, ad-hoc portals, and email chains to move data. There are delays at every
            stage—not because of satellites, but because there is no infrastructure layer connecting upstream sources to downstream decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without that layer, EO programs stall. Imagery sits idle. Operators burn hours scheduling. Analysts waste time on format conversion instead of
            interpretation. Even with sensors in orbit, visibility on the ground remains manual.
          </p>

          <h2>Infrastructure Is the Fix</h2>
          <p>
            An EO program that runs on infrastructure does not treat imagery as a one-off deliverable. It treats it as data: ordered, standardised, governed,
            routed, and delivered the same way every other enterprise dataset already is. This shift is non-optional. The pressure is real, and it is felt first
            in the places where reliability matters most.
          </p>

          <h3>Operational Risk: National Security, Maritime Domain Awareness</h3>
          <p>
            Operational agencies are not short on imagery. They are short on control. Tasking is still routed manually. Scheduling decisions are separated from
            field requirements. Fulfilment lives in disconnected systems with no audit trail and no time guarantees.
          </p>
          <p>An EODI-compliant program eliminates that friction:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tasking requests are API-triggered, not emailed</li>
            <li>Constellations (sovereign, allied, commercial) are coordinated in one system</li>
            <li>Capture conditions (weather, latency, obliquity) are modelled automatically</li>
            <li>Deliveries are traceable, format-aligned, and structured for ISR ingest</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The outcome is not just faster imagery. It is confirmed delivery, known latency, and the ability to operate without uncertainty in time-critical
            scenarios.
          </p>

          <h3>Environmental Monitoring: Mining, Fire Detection, Methane, Weed Control</h3>
          <p>
            Monitoring programs often have sensors and schedules—but no reactive loop. Tailings inspections are a prime example. A dam sensor trips, alerts go
            out, and then… someone checks satellite availability by hand. Imagery might arrive a week later, with no alignment to the event.
          </p>
          <p>Under EODI:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Threshold breaches trigger satellite and drone tasking in real time</li>
            <li>Multi-sensor assets are scheduled together (optical, SAR, thermal)</li>
            <li>Raw imagery is converted to STAC-aligned formats on ingest</li>
            <li>Results are routed into risk dashboards, SCADA overlays, or audit workflows</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This structure removes blind spots, shortens response times, and ensures every event is logged with visual evidence tied to the alert that triggered
            it.
          </p>

          <h3>EO &amp; Space Data: Satellite Operators, Imagery Aggregators, Space Agencies</h3>
          <p>
            The current pipeline for most satellite operators is still manual. Orders are placed through forms or emails. Tasking is managed in spreadsheets.
            Archive access is gated behind human review. Sales and fulfilment workflows do not scale without adding headcount.
          </p>
          <p>With EODI infrastructure:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Customers use self-serve portals backed by API-driven tasking and delivery</li>
            <li>Tasking logic is handled by digital twin models that simulate capture feasibility</li>
            <li>Fulfilment is routed automatically, with status tracking at each step</li>
            <li>Data delivery is standardised, searchable, and usage-governed</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This turns a manual order desk into a functional data platform. It also makes it possible to support long-tail customers, channel partners, and
            government frameworks without duplicating workflows or risking SLA violations.
          </p>
