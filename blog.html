          <p>
            Every modern data system assumes one thing: infrastructure. Whether it’s aviation safety, border security, wildfire risk, or commodity logistics,
            the data flows through structured systems with built-in automation, access control, and observability. Earth Observation is the outlier.

          <p>
            Despite the rise of satellites and sensors, EO programs still rely on PDFs, ad-hoc portals, and email chains to move data. There are delays at every
            stage—not because of satellites, but because there is no infrastructure layer connecting upstream sources to downstream decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without that layer, EO programs stall. Imagery sits idle. Operators burn hours scheduling. Analysts waste time on format conversion instead of
            interpretation. Even with sensors in orbit, visibility on the ground remains manual.
          </p>

          <h2>Infrastructure Is the Fix</h2>
          <p>
            An EO program that runs on infrastructure does not treat imagery as a one-off deliverable. It treats it as data: ordered, standardised, governed,
            routed, and delivered the same way every other enterprise dataset already is. This shift is non-optional. The pressure is real, and it is felt first
            in the places where reliability matters most.
          </p>

          <h3>Operational Risk: National Security, Maritime Domain Awareness</h3>
          <p>
            Operational agencies are not short on imagery. They are short on control. Tasking is still routed manually. Scheduling decisions are separated from
            field requirements. Fulfilment lives in disconnected systems with no audit trail and no time guarantees.
          </p>
          <p>An EODI-compliant program eliminates that friction:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tasking requests are API-triggered, not emailed</li>
            <li>Constellations (sovereign, allied, commercial) are coordinated in one system</li>
            <li>Capture conditions (weather, latency, obliquity) are modelled automatically</li>
            <li>Deliveries are traceable, format-aligned, and structured for ISR ingest</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The outcome is not just faster imagery. It is confirmed delivery, known latency, and the ability to operate without uncertainty in time-critical
            scenarios.
          </p>

          <h3>Environmental Monitoring: Mining, Fire Detection, Methane, Weed Control</h3>
          <p>
            Monitoring programs often have sensors and schedules—but no reactive loop. Tailings inspections are a prime example. A dam sensor trips, alerts go
            out, and then… someone checks satellite availability by hand. Imagery might arrive a week later, with no alignment to the event.
          </p>
          <p>Under EODI:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Threshold breaches trigger satellite and drone tasking in real time</li>
            <li>Multi-sensor assets are scheduled together (optical, SAR, thermal)</li>
            <li>Raw imagery is converted to STAC-aligned formats on ingest</li>
            <li>Results are routed into risk dashboards, SCADA overlays, or audit workflows</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This structure removes blind spots, shortens response times, and ensures every event is logged with visual evidence tied to the alert that triggered
            it.
          </p>

          <h3>EO &amp; Space Data: Satellite Operators, Imagery Aggregators, Space Agencies</h3>
          <p>
            The current pipeline for most satellite operators is still manual. Orders are placed through forms or emails. Tasking is managed in spreadsheets.
            Archive access is gated behind human review. Sales and fulfilment workflows do not scale without adding headcount.
          </p>
          <p>With EODI infrastructure:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Customers use self-serve portals backed by API-driven tasking and delivery</li>
            <li>Tasking logic is handled by digital twin models that simulate capture feasibility</li>
            <li>Fulfilment is routed automatically, with status tracking at each step</li>
            <li>Data delivery is standardised, searchable, and usage-governed</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This turns a manual order desk into a functional data platform. It also makes it possible to support long-tail customers, channel partners, and
            government frameworks without duplicating workflows or risking SLA violations.
          </p>

          <div class="milestone">
            <h5>Day 91–180</h5>

              <li>Expand sensor sources, users, and geographic coverage</li>
              <li>Apply governance: audit trails, licensing, usage limits, and expiry controls</li>
              <li>Decommission manual workflows (email fulfilment, static portals, ad-hoc spreadsheets)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            After six months, EO data moves the way it should: securely, automatically, and predictably—through infrastructure, not inboxes.
